Assignment 1: Real-World Scenario (Builder Pattern)
Consider a scenario where you are tasked with developing a meal customization system for a restaurant.
The system needs to construct diverse meal options with varying components such as appetizers, main
courses, side dishes, and desserts. Each meal type may have specific dietary preferences, making the
construction process complex.
Design a system using the Builder pattern to implement this meal customization system. The builder
should handle the step-wise construction of meals, allowing customers to choose from a variety of components for their personalized dining experience.


Assignment 2: Real-World Scenario (Factory Pattern)
Imagine you are developing a dynamic vehicle assembly line system for an automobile manufacturing
company. The system should be capable of producing various types of vehicles, including cars, trucks, and
motorcycles. Each vehicle type has unique specifications, such as the number of doors, cargo capacity,
and engine type.
Apply the Factory pattern to design this vehicle assembly system. Create concrete factories for each
vehicle type (CarFactory, TruckFactory, MotorcycleFactory) that generate instances of the respective
vehicles. The system should be flexible enough to accommodate new vehicle types in the future.
